# hello-world

 Dear Red,
 If you're reading this, then you're out. One way or another, you're out. And f
 you've followed along this far, you might be willing to come a little further.
 I think you remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man
 to help me get my project on wheels. Meantime, have a drink on me-and do think
 it over. I will be keeping an eye out for you. Remember that hope is a good
 thing, Red, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be
 hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.
 
 Your friend,
 Peter Stevens
